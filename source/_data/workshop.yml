    description: "8 hours long deep dive into testing real-world backends that have APIs, Database, message queues, integrations, and microservices"
    description_long:
        "<strong>What is it about:</strong>
        <br> This 8 hours long workshop is a very deep dive into writing real-world and modern backend testing. But hey, what is modern testing? Most traditional testing guides focus on testing functions and units.
        In their daily routine though, developers are challenged with covering all the layers of their components - Database, APIs, MQ, metrics, 3rd parties, and more - not just logic functions. For this good reason, the 'Testing Diamond' model is getting super popular as it advocates writing tests that mitigate all the risks.
        This workshop is all about writing these tests in the RIGHT way. Overall, it packs 30+ best practices and 20 hands-on exercises that will open your mind to modern testing techniques. This workshop is based on Yoni's GitHub testing best practices guides (<a href='https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices'>one</a>, <a href='https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices'>two</a>, <a href='https://github.com/testjavascript/nodejs-integration-tests-best-practices'>three</a>) (‚ú® 85,000 stars).
        <br> <br />
        <strong>üéÅ Bonus:</strong>
        <br> Participants of this workshop will get access to Yoni's online 6 hours testing course.        <br>
        <strong>üéÅ Bonus2:</strong>
        <br> Additional training Zoom gathering in June is included.
        <br>
        <br> <br />
        <strong>What's in there for me:</strong>
        <ul>
         <li>‚Ä¢ The latest and greatest of backend testing</li>
         <li>‚Ä¢ Double click into the most talk-about model of recent years, the testing diamond</li>
         <li>‚Ä¢ Down to the minute details - This is not an overview rather a comprehensive code-level drill that covers 40+ best practices</li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br />"
