  content_1: "We are involved in many ways in order to build a better environment in tech for everyone. In 2016 we became <strong>Diversity Sponsor</strong> of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1817732114/the-phpdiversity-rainbow-elephpant'>The PHPDiversity Rainbow Elephpant campaign</a> on Kickstarter when the project was seemingly about to end without making it. We are very proud that many others followed us and that the project reached its goal. In 2019 we sponsored and organised for the first time <a target='_blank' href='http://railsgirls.com/verona2019.html'>RailsGirls Verona</a>, a free coding workshop for women."
  content_2: "We know very well that for some people attending a conference could be difficult, because of personal or financial circumstances. That's why we offer discounted or free tickets especially to those who are underrepresented and marginalised in tech (women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, people with disabilities, minorities, or other under-represented groups) and anybody who would otherwise be unable to attend without financial assistance."
